## Summary

`image-set` is a CSS function that allows you to make an image responsive, showing variations of the same picture for different screen resolutions when needed. 
This function is almost the same as the HTML srcset attribute for img tags.
We should always make our web images responsive so as to render high-quality images on different devices (known as **resolution switching**),
 load the right images on different screen sizes. (known as **art direction**), and for faster loading of web pages.
