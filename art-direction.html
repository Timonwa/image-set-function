        >This image has a fixed height of 400px with the width taking the full
        width of the screen but having a maximum width of 1400px. It doesn't
        have any specific detail that it is showing to the user, hence looks
        good on any screen size and because the image has been set to adjust
        itself to cover any space it finds itself in, it doesn't look stretched
        on any screen size.</figcaption

      <img
        class="fixed2"
        src="./img/landscape-view.jpg"
        alt="landscape view of a woman standing in front of a multi-colored wall"
      />
      <figcaption
        >This image has a fixed height of 700px with the width taking the full
        width of the screen but having a maximum width of 1400px. Its main focus
        or detail to the user is the lady. Its orientation is landscaped. This
        image also adjusts itself to cover any space it finds itself in, but
        unlike the first image which looks good on any screen size, this
        doesn't. On smaller screens, parts of the lady get cut off and she then
        becomes too large for the user to view.

        alt="landscape view of a woman standing in front of a multi-colored wall"
      />
      <figcaption
        >With the same image used above, we have removed the fixed height and
        object fit but left the width the same and its orientation is still
        landscaped. On different screen sizes, it maintains the same aspect
        ratio, adjusting the height of the image to accommodate its relative
        width so we can see every major and minor detail in it. We can easily
        view the lady in the image on larger screens but not on smaller
        screens.</figcaption

      <img

        alt="portrait view of a woman standing in front of a multi-colored wall"
      />
      <figcaption
        >If we switch the image from the landscaped orientation to a version of
        it in portrait orientation and use it on smaller screens, we can then
        easily see the details of the lady once again. But when using this same
        image for larger screens, it becomes too large for the user to view the
        image or lady at first glance.</figcaption
